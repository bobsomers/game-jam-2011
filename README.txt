    SUPER JETPACK ROCKET DINOSAUR DEATHMATCH v0.00001a
================================================================================

Made in 48 hours at the Cal Poly Global Game Jam 2011, hosted by CPGD (Cal Poly
Game Development).

================================================================================
    THE NARRATIVE THUS FAR
================================================================================

The dinosaur extinction was a government coverup. In actuality, time travelers
from the future went back 65 million years into the past, strapped jetpacks onto
dinosaurs, and made them fight to the death with rocket launchers.

Nothing about this situation is fully thought out.

================================================================================
    HOW TO PLAY
================================================================================

Shoot as many T-Rex's as you can before time runs out! Each time you hit a T-Rex
with a rocket you get one point.

Please don't spam the rockets to much though, unless you enjoy crashing the
game. :)

When time runs out, close the window and rerun to play again. Really. Sorry
about that. :(

================================================================================
    CONTORLS
================================================================================

ENTER - Start the game from the title screen.
A - Thrust jetpack to the left.
D - Thrust jetpack to the right.
SPACE - Right yourself if you get stuck upside down.
LEFT ARROW - Shoot rockets from your tail.
RIGHT ARROW - Shoot rockets from your back.

================================================================================
    KNOWN BUGS
================================================================================

There are a lot of them, but in 48 hours what did you expect!

Jetpacks used to be a LOT easier to control before the dino was fully rigged
with a head, neck, and tail. It's much harder to control now. It can be made
easier through tweaking, especially the autocorrection forces that try to keep
you afloat.

You can spam the space bar and become this twirling, rocket-firing brotosaurus
ball of death. Try it, it's amusing.

Rockets can blow up other rockets, so if you fire them too quickly from your
back or tail they will blow each other up. Also, spamming rockets quickly can
lead to a crash.

The character rigging is a bit sketchy at times...

...and many, many, more.
